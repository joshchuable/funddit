History has shown that many people support projects for many reasons, including the relationship to the organizer or offered rewards. However, the main reason why people fun projects is because they can identify themselves with your proposal."

Only Campaign Creators pay fees on Funddit. Contributors use Funddit’s services free of charge.  Funddit charges a 6.5% fee on all successfully funded projects. WePay charges a XX% on all successfully funded projects, adding up to a total of XX%.  If a project fails, all contributed funds will be returned to the Contributors’ accounts in form of credit.

      title_one: "What inspired you to make this project?"
      tip_one: "People only engage when they realize the importance of a cause for society or for the person who leads a campaign. So be very clear about what is your inspiration and let it overflow into your project."
      title_two: "What is the focus?"
      tip_two: "Catarse is an excellent way to take the first steps. Therefore, define very well the purpose of your project, as well as who will benefit from it. Clearly defining your objectives is one of the best ways to engage people."

      title_five: "Have you thought about the project rewards?"
